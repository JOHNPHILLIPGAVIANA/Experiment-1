# Experiment-1
This repository contains the solutions of the given problems from the Programming Assignment 1/Experiment 1. The assignment solely focuses on the basic usage of python as the programming language to solve various problems by creating functions that align with each type of problem. In this experiment, three problems were solved by creating specific and distinct functions: These are the Alphabet Soup Problem, which sorted the letters of each word input alphabetically, Emoticon Problem, which replaces specific words in a sentence with their corresponding emoticon, and the Unpacking List Problem which unpacks a specific variable and list them into either First, Middle, Last.
